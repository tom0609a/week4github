The confusion matrix confirms high agreement between the model and ESA’s classification.
8856 ccorrectly classified as sea ice
3293 ccorrectly classified as leads
22 leads misclassified as sea ice
24 sea ice misclassified as leads
So, only 46samples were misclassified out of 12195 samples.
Therefore the classification model is reliable. 

The classification report shows the precision and recall aligns closely with ESA's official labels.
Overall, the echo classification is highly accurate, with strong alignment to ESA’s official dataset.
